## About the Collection

This collection contains 29 digitized items from collections from the IU Archives. These collections are C627 Student Recipes and C598 Indiana University Department of Home Economics. The motivation to create this was because the IU Archive and other Libraries on Campus use recipe cards for holidays and to give out. This way there are some recipes in once place for people to look at and use that are from IU Collections. Being able to have the recipies in one place helps the libraries be able to distribute a wider collection. This also showcases the history of IU with collections from the Student Folklore Papers and the Department of Home Economics. These collections are used frequently, and having some items digitized from these collections helps with classes and departments who use these items. Having recipes in one places makes it easier to access these recipies from anywhere.  

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
