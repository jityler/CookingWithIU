## Acknowledgments

Thank you [University Archives](https://libraries.indiana.edu/university-archives) for granting me access to these materials and letting me use the collections. A special thanks to Carrie Schwier for helping find the different collections to use in the collections and providing me with the relevent documents needed to create this repository.  
The metadata used in this collection was by Dublin Core standards. Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) were used as controlled vocabulary for the Subjects. LanguaL, a food thesuarus, was used in the Key Ingredients as the controlled vocabulary.
